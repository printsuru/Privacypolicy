Privacy Policy for Image Tools Extension
Last Updated: May 09, 2025
Thank you for using the Image Tools Extension ("the Extension"). This Privacy Policy describes how your information is handled when you use our Extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a clear understanding of our data practices.
Information We Do Not Collect
The Image Tools Extension is designed to operate entirely locally on your computer. We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) or any other sensitive user data. All image processing, including editing, conversion, and compression, occurs directly within your browser on your local device.
Permissions Requested
To provide its functionalities, the Extension requests the following permissions:
storage: This permission is used to save your preferences or settings locally within your browser. For example, it might remember your last used tool or specific settings for a tool to enhance your user experience. This data is stored only on your device and is not accessed or transmitted by us.
downloads: This permission is required to allow you to download the images you process using the Extension. When you choose to download an edited, converted, or compressed image, this permission enables the Extension to save the file to your computer's designated downloads folder or a location you specify.
How Your Data is Handled
Image Data: All images you upload to the Extension for processing remain on your local device. The Extension processes these images within your browser. At no point are your images uploaded to, stored on, or transmitted to any external servers or third parties by the Extension.
Local Storage: Any settings or preferences saved by the Extension using the storage permission are stored locally in your browser's storage. You have control over this data through your browser's settings, including the ability to clear it.
Downloads: When you download a processed image, the file is saved directly to your computer. The Extension does not keep a copy of your downloaded files, nor does it track your download activity.
Third-Party Services
The Image Tools Extension does not integrate with or utilize any third-party services that would collect or access your data.
Data Security
Since all data processing and storage occur locally on your device, the security of your data is primarily dependent on the security of your own computer and browser. We do not implement any additional security measures beyond those inherent in the Chrome browser environment for local operations.
Children's Privacy
The Extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with information, please contact us, although, as stated, the Extension does not collect or transmit user data.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the "Last Updated" date at thetop of this policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about our data practices.
